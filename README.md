# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

Artificial Intelligence Mini-Project for Sem VI 

This Twitter Sentiment Analyzer helps detect the Hate Speech using two of the different datasets that we found on surfing the web

  * Sentiment140 Dataset

    * It contains 1.6 million tweets extracted using the Twitter API
    
    * The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment
    
    * **Sentiment Analysis is done by introducing Polarizing and Subjectivity to classify the data as positives and negatives and plaot them on a bar graph, to display the weightage of positive tweets, negative tweets and the neutral tweets**

    * Formally, given a training sample of tweets and labels, where label '1' denotes the tweet is racist/sexist and label '0' denotes the tweet is not racist/sexist, our objective was to predict the labels on the test dataset
